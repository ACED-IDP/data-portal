            "DetailedDescription": "The study will employ a randomized, allocation-concealed, multicenter, placebo-controlled, multi-period crossover design (Schmid et al, 2018). This multi-period crossover randomized, controlled trial allows comparability and assessment of efficacy through repeated exposures within each subject to the active treatment and a control (placebo) in randomized sequence. Such multi-period crossover designs are ideal for treatments with rapid onset of action and short half-life such as the asset under study here. We have strived to minimize the complexity of this powerful design by using only 2 blocks with 2 periods each. The modest additional complexity of the proposed multi-period crossover design, compared to a parallel-groups design, is justified by the marked improvement in efficiency. The gains in efficiency afforded by the multi-period crossover design allow a substantial reduction in sample size without sacrificing statistical power. For example, our simulation experiments (with sample sizes ranging from 30 to 50, carryover effects ranging from 0 to 0.2, and an effect size of 0.4) indicated that the parallel design yields statistical power ranging from 0.20-0.25, whereas our proposed 2-block multi-period crossover design yields power ranging from 0.9-1.0.\n\nThe trial will compare an active treatment vs. placebo. Each arm of the study will employ a multi-period crossover design with two blocks. Each block will consist of two treatment periods with each period lasting 6 weeks. Treatment assignments (active drug versus placebo) will be randomized for each patient to the two periods within each block. The period length of 6 weeks was chosen based on several considerations: (i) Most efficacious analgesic drugs demonstrate separation from placebo by 6 weeks; (ii) The decision to move CNTX-6970 forward to Phase 3 will require a clinically meaningful separation from placebo by 6 weeks; (iii) In this Phase 2 study, implementing a treatment block longer than 6 weeks would make the overall design more challenging and burdensome by extending the duration of overall testing beyond 6 months; (iv) Recent meta-analyses suggest that anti-inflammatory treatments such as NSAIDs reach peak effects on pain within a 4-week timeframe in patients with knee osteoarthritis, and multiple RCTs have specifically demonstrated efficacy for celecoxib at 2-6 weeks (Osani et al, 2020).\n\nThe comparison with celecoxib is used to evaluate \"assay sensitivity,\" i.e., to assess the study protocol's ability to demonstrate superiority of an established efficacious treatment (celecoxib 100mg BID). In this study, the placebo will consist of inactive tablets identical to the active treatment tablets. Treatment assignments (active drug versus placebo) will be randomized for each patient to the two treatment periods within each block",

          "abstract_text": "SUMMARY/ABSTRACT. Chronic, non-cancer pain is a significant unmet health need worldwide. The prevalence of chronic pain among. adults in the United States has been estimated at between 11 and 43%. The personal toll of living with chronic. pain is immense, and the economic impact can be devastating. One of the most widely used treatments for. chronic pain is opioid analgesics. While the appropriate use of opioids can be an important and effective part of. pain management, the United States is currently facing a national crisis resulting from widespread opioid. addiction, believed to be the direct product of overprescription. Importantly, there is evidence of a pathological. interaction between opioids and the immune system that can contribute to both opioid tolerance and elevated. levels of pain. Chronic pain conditions for which opioids are most often prescribed have been shown to involve. dysregulation of the immune system, which may contribute to pathological effects of opioid use in these patients.. To ensure proper treatment and restrict opioids to those conditions for which they will be most effective without. further exacerbation of pain, it will be essential to identify the underlying pathophysiology driving pain in a given. patient. Importantly, there are currently no unbiased, mechanism-based methods for pain diagnosis. Given the. variability in self-reported pain measurements and unclear etiology of a majority of chronic pain conditions, an. objective tool that could identify the nature of pain and stratify patients into treatment groups would be an. important advancement in medicine. In particular, identifying patients who would be ill-suited for opioid treatment. would have a major impact on public health. To address this unmet need, we propose to develop a reliable,. cost effective and non-invasive in vitro diagnostic assay for chronic pain with an underlying. inflammatory pathology. This blood test will be available to primary care physicians and results will be clear. and actionable..  In this Phase I application, we will use phage display biopanning and next generation sequencing to identify. peptides that bind autoantibodies uniquely associated with patients who have widespread chronic pain. We will. identify a unique peptide signature that can be used to objectively identify patients with these biomarkers and. develop a prototype peptide array that is capable of reproducibly detecting a specific set of antibodies from. serum. In Phase 2, we plan to use the chronic pain peptide signature to further develop a clinically useful array. specific for determining the presence of a pain-related autoantibody signature. Affinergys device for objectively. identifying an inflammation-induced chronic pain signature will play an important role in assessing pain and. distinguishing those patients who should not receive opioids as a first line treatment.",

          "study_description_summary": "One of the most widely used treatments for chronic pain is opioid analgesics. Importantly, there is evidence of a pathological interaction between opioids and the immune system that can contribute to both opioid tolerance and elevated levels of pain. Chronic pain conditions for which opioids are most often prescribed have been shown to involve dysregulation of the immune system, which may contribute to pathological effects of opioid use in these patients. To address this unmet need, this study aims to develop a reliable, cost-effective, and non-invasive in vitro diagnostic assay for chronic pain with an underlying inflammatory pathology, as a blood test available in primary care settings, with the hope that doctors can use the test to identify which patients might benefit less from opioids and be more likely to become addicted.",

          "abstract_text": "Project Summary/Abstract. Across the US, substance use (SU) is a significant public health concern. Rates of opioid use disorders have. increased exponentially, with 60% of overdoses attributed to heroin and illicit synthetics. Although opioid use. among youth is low compared to adults, experimentation and regular use increases later in adolescence as. youth transition to adulthood. Juvenile justice (JJ)-involved youth represent a particularly vulnerable population,. as they often experience mental health disorders, dysfunctional family/social relationships, and complex. trauma, placing them at greater risk for SU and substance use disorders (SUDs). To ensure that these youth. do not become another opioid statistic, innovative and effective prevention interventions are needed. We. propose to adapt and test an intervention for preventing initiation and/or escalation of opioid misuse among. older JJ-involved adolescents. The target enrollment group will be youth aging out of JJ (16-18 years) who are. transitioning to their communities after a period of detainment in a secure treatment or correctional facility.. Trust-based Relational Intervention (TBRI; a relational, attachment-based intervention that promotes. emotional regulation through interaction with responsive adults) will be adapted as a prevention intervention. targeting youth at risk for SU (especially non-medical use of opioids). Safe adults (e.g., parent/guardian) will be. trained in behavior management techniques for empowering youth to appropriately express their needs,. connecting them with others in pro-social ways, and correcting or reshaping undesirable behavior. The. proposed Effectiveness/Implementation study will be conducted in 3 phases. Phase 1 will adapt elements of. TBRI for JJ youth, develop intervention manuals and study protocols, examine the acceptability of the adapted. intervention, and test the feasibility of the proposed study protocol (e.g., agency and youth recruitment).. Feedback from 15 youth/safe adult dyads will be solicited as part of this phase. Phase 2 will examine both the. effectiveness of TBRI for preventing opioid misuse and the comparative utility of three support formats: (1). TBRI Training only, (2) TBRI Training + Structured Coaching, or (3) TBRI Training + Responsive Coaching. (triggered by the youths need/risk). A total of 360 youth/safe adult dyads will be recruited from 6 participating. JJ facilities over a 3-year period, and followed for 18 months post-release (20 youth-adult dyads/year per. facility). This design enables a comparison of TBRI versus SRP (using a stepped-wedge design where each. facility serves as its own control) plus a randomized control trial comparing 3 TBRI support formats. Phase 3. will examine barriers and facilitators of TBRI sustainment. Sixty JJ staff (10 from each agency) will provide. input annually via focus groups and surveys. TCU will work with administrators and staff at each JJ facility to. implement a sustainment plan, which will include developing in-house TBRI expertise (i.e., staff training and. implementation assistance). Successful completion of study aims will provide a test of the adapted intervention. and will facilitate sustainment by providing training and implementation support to participating facilities.",

The current study proposes to adapt and test an intervention Trust-based Relational InterventionÂ® (TBRIÂ®) for preventing initiation and/or escalation of opioid misuse among older adolescents involved in the JJ system. Successful completion of study aims will provide information on TBRI's utility for older JJ adolescents, barriers and facilitators of sustainment, and provide training and implementation support for sustainment in participating facilities.",

            "DetailedDescription": "Across the US, substance use (SU) is a significant public health concern, with an estimated 11.1 million misusing prescription opioids. Rates of opioid use disorders (OUDs) have increased exponentially, with 60% of overdoses attributed to heroin and illicit synthetics (such as Fentanyl). Although opioid use among youth is low compared to adults, experimentation and regular use increases later in adolescence as youth transition to adulthood. Juvenile justice (JJ)-involved youth represent a particularly vulnerable population, as they often experience mental health disorders, dysfunctional family/social relationships, and complex trauma, placing them at greater risk for SU and substance use disorders (SUDs). To ensure that these youth do not become another opioid statistic, innovative and effective prevention interventions are needed. The investigators propose to adapt and test an intervention for preventing initiation and/or escalation of opioid misuse among older JJ-involved adolescents. The target enrollment group will be youth aging out of JJ (15-18 years at study enrollment) who are transitioning to their communities after a period of detainment in a secure treatment or correctional facility. Trust-based Relational InterventionÂ® (TBRIÂ®; a relational, attachment-based intervention that promotes emotional regulation through interaction with responsive adults) will be adapted as a prevention intervention targeting youth at risk for SU (especially non-medical use of opioids). Safe adults (e.g., parent/guardian, extended family member) will be trained in behavior management techniques for empowering youth to appropriately express their needs, connecting them with others in pro-social ways, and correcting or reshaping undesirable behavior. The proposed Effectiveness/Implementation study will examine both the effectiveness of TBRI for preventing opioid misuse and the comparative utility of three support formats: (1) TBRI Training only, (2) TBRI Training + Structured Coaching, or (3) TBRI Training + Responsive Coaching (triggered by the youth's need/risk). A total of 360 youth/safe adult dyads will be recruited from 9 participating JJ facilities over a 3-year period, and followed for 18 months post-release (15 youth-adult dyads/year per facility). This design enables a comparison of TBRI versus Standard Reentry Practice (SRP; using a stepped-wedge design where each facility serves as its own control) plus a randomized control trial comparing 3 TBRI support formats. This study will also examine barriers and facilitators of TBRI sustainment. Ninety JJ staff (10 from each agency) will provide input annually via focus groups and surveys. TCU will work with administrators and staff at each JJ facility to implement a sustainment plan, which will include developing in-house TBRI expertise (i.e., staff training and implementation assistance). Successful completion of study aims will provide a test of the adapted intervention and will facilitate sustainment by providing training and implementation support to participating facilities.",

This new chemical entity, called Kindolor, has significant. additional benefits of being able to prevent the development of chronic pain if administered soon after tissue. injury, including post-operative conditions. Kindolor also has a highly significant opiate sparing effect in. conditions that may require the use of opiates, since Kindolor demonstrates a strong synergistic effect with. morphine. In this grant application we are requesting funds to complete cGMP synthesis and GLP studies. necessary for an IND application to the FDA, and given the FDA approval of the IND status, the completion of. the first in human, Phase I clinical studies for safety and Phase 2a studies of efficacy to bring our medication to. chronic pain sufferers.",

          "abstract_text": "Over 100 million adults in the U.S. suffer from intermittent or constant chronic pain, and chronic pain affects at. least 10% of the worlds population. The primary pharmaceuticals for treatment of chronic pain have been natural. or synthetic opioids and the use of opioids for pain treatment has resulted in what has been called an epidemic. of opioid abuse, addiction and lethal overdoses. We have, through a process of rational drug design, generated. a new chemical entity (NCE) and have given it the name Kindolor. Kindolor is a non-opiate, non-addicting. molecule that was developed specifically to simultaneously control the aberrant activity of three targets on the. peripheral sensory system that are integral in the development and propagation of chronic pain. Kindolor acts. as an inhibitor of the pain propagating Nav1.7 and Nav1.8 sodium channels and as an inhibitor of NMDA receptors. that act to magnify pain signals (Fig A). We have generated a process to synthesize Kindolor at 99% purity. In. our pre-clinical studies we have demonstrated the efficacy of Kindolor to reduce or eliminate chronic pain. generated in five animal models at doses compatible with use of Kindolor in humans. We have generated. evidence that this broad range of efficacy is a result of the multi-target engagement by Kindolor. We have. generated the initial evidence for the safety (high TI) of Kindolor and its uneventful metabolism. Additional. attractive features of Kindolor are that it can prevent the development of chronic pain if given soon after tissue. injury. And if combined with low doses of opiates, Kindolor produces a substantial opiate sparing effect through. synergistic actions with the opiates. To bring Kindolor to the public, we are proposing to complete the pre-clinical. studies necessary for an IND application to the FDA and, if the IND is approved, the completion of a Phase 1a. and 1b, first in human, study of the safety of our compound, and then a Phase 2a study of efficacy on pain of. osteoarthritis. To start, we will have Kindolor synthesized using cGMP procedures. This will include development. of methods for scaling up production quantities. We will produce a formulation for oral drug administration to. humans and will use this formulation for GLP studies of pharmacokinetics and toxicokinetics in two species of. animals (rat and minipig). We will complete GLP studies of safety of the formulation in the two species, including. escalating dose experiments and sub-chronic dosing for 28 days with low, moderate, and high doses of the drug. product. These studies will include a 14 day recovery period to assess delayed toxicity. Genotoxicity studies will. also be completed, as will specific assessments of cardiovascular and respiratory toxicity prior to a pre-IND. meeting with the FDA. The satisfactory completion of the pre-IND meeting will allow for expedient completion of. the IND application. Given approval of the IND application, we propose to complete the Phase Ia and 1b study. and the Phase 2a study. In all, our goal is to bring our compound to a full Phase 2 ready stage for licensing or. partnering with a Pharma company willing and able to bring the medication to the chronic pain sufferer.",

Despite the alarming increases. in opioid misuse and OUD, few integrated treatments target both chronic pain and OUD. Integrated holistic. treatments are desperately needed that simultaneously address pain and opioid use, the fundamental causes. of pain and OUD, and that focus on whole person functioning and well-being among individuals with chronic. pain and opioid misuse/OUD. The University of New Mexico (UNM) Integrative Management of chronic Pain. and Opioid use disorder for Whole Recovery (IMPOWR) Center will take an integrated and holistic approach to. improving the lives of patients with chronic pain and opioid misuse/OUD via tailored intervention approaches to. meet the needs of diverse individuals in diverse communities. We will explicitly target increasing quality of life. and engagement in valued activities, the cultural centering of interventions to meet the needs of diverse patient. populations, and reducing stigma of chronic pain and opioid misuse and OUD. The approaches proposed in. our IMPOWR Center will directly target whole person functioning and well-being among individuals with chronic. pain and misuse/OUD. Our goals are to develop, test, and implement scalable, generalizable, and sustainable. provider- and patient-level interventions that are focused on improving functioning and can be delivered in. diverse health care settings. To maximize impact, we have established a diverse Stakeholder Consultation. Board (including people with lived experience and other stakeholders) and a Scientific Advisory Board. (including experts in chronic pain, opioid misuse/OUD, and implementation science), and aim to build a. sustainable workforce of researchers and providers devoted to ameliorating chronic pain and OUD via training. and mentoring. All Center projects will embrace principles of community-based participatory research, team. science, implementation science, economic evaluation, and open science. Consistent with our patient-centered. approach, assessment of opioid use and chronic pain will be complemented with measures of psychosocial. functioning and other important life domains, including stigma, engagement in valued activities, and quality of. life. Projects will include economic evaluation to measure cost-effectiveness of our interventions from a societal. perspective. Specific research projects will test the effectiveness, mechanisms, and implementation of an. integrated psychosocial treatment for chronic pain and OUD among individuals receiving buprenorphine from. outpatient OUD treatment clinics, and will use community-based participatory research methods to develop a. culturally-centered implementation intervention for screening and brief intervention of chronic pain and OUD. among American Indian/Alaska Native patients in primary care settings. Pilot projects focused on chronic pain. and OUD will be selected by our Stakeholder Consultation Board. The UNM IMPOWR Center is committed to. data harmonization, sharing of study resources, and provider training to enhance the reach, effectiveness,. adoption, implementation, and maintenance of evidence-based treatments for chronic pain and OUD.",

          "abstract_text": "Acute and chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) are a major health concern across the lifespan. Adolescents undergoing invasive musculoskeletal surgeries are particularly at risk, with 20% developing CPSP and associated deterioration in health-related quality of life (HRQL). Further, neurobiological and psychosocial changes during adolescence increase vulnerability to addiction, placing these youth at elevated risk for developing persistent opioid use following surgery. Despite research demonstrating the importance of psychological factors in persistence of pain and opioid use following surgery, standard perioperative care in youth relies on opioids to treat pain. Non-pharmacological interventions are not accessible or widely used in this population. Our own studies demonstrate efficacy of mHealth psychosocial interventions to improve chronic pain-related outcomes in youth. Other published data support efficacy of psychosocial interventions to reduce acute postsurgical pain in adolescents. Using stakeholder input, our team adapted our highly successful technology-delivered pain self-management intervention for the perioperative period in a program called SurgeryPal. We developed two distinct interventions to be delivered during 1) the pre-operative phase to target psychosocial risk factors, and 2) the post-operative phase to teach pain self-management skills. The goal of this proposal is to establish the effectiveness of our mHealth perioperative psychosocial intervention to improve clinically meaningful outcomes in adolescents undergoing major musculoskeletal surgery, and to identify the optimal timing of intervention delivery. During the UG3, our team will work cooperatively with the HEAL ERN Program to plan for the efficient implementation of our proposed multi-site randomized clinical trial at 25 collaborating centers and will ready our interventions for deployment. During the UH3 phase, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial in 500 youth age 12-18 years undergoing spinal fusion surgery and their parents. In addition to standard perioperative care, participants will be randomized using a factorial design to receive psychosocial intervention (SurgeryPal) or education (attention control condition) at two treatment phases, each of 4-weeks duration (pre-operative and post-operative) to test timing of intervention delivery. Primary study outcomes are acute pain severity and interference assessed over the first 2 weeks after surgery, and chronic pain intensity and interference at 3-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes include HRQL, psychosocial distress, sleep disturbance, and opioid use and misuse. We will examine synergy of psychosocial intervention during both treatment phases, and explore underlying treatment mechanisms of prevention of transition from acute to CPSP over 6 months.  This project represents a significant advance in innovative approaches to deliver non-pharmacological therapies to youth undergoing major musculoskeletal surgeries, which may effect a paradigm shift in clinical practice. This intervention has potential to be integrated into pediatric surgery programs across the country to reduce incidence of CPSP and potential for addiction.",

Interventions to improve recovery and reduce pain after surgery have potential to interrupt a negative trajectory of suffering and disability associated with chronic pain. Our specific aims are: Primary: (1) Determine effectiveness of a pre-operative mHealth psychosocial intervention to improve acute pain outcomes in adolescents undergoing major musculoskeletal surgery, (2) Determine effectiveness of a post-operative mHealth psychosocial intervention to improve chronic pain outcomes at 3 months in adolescents undergoing major musculoskeletal surgery, (3) Determine the combined effects of pre- and post-operative psychosocial intervention on chronic pain outcomes. Secondary: (1) Determine effectiveness of pre-operative psychosocial intervention to reduce opioid use during the 14 days following hospital discharge, (2) Determine effectiveness of psychosocial intervention to improve health-related quality of life following surgery.",

          "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY.  The current US opioid crisis fueled by over 225 million annual prescriptions of mu-opioid receptor (MOR). agonist analgesics and characterized by unprecedented levels of addiction, abuse and death by overdose, has. emphasized the need for novel, efficacious, non-addictive and safe analgesics. The proposed program seeks to. develop a first-in-class (FIC), peripherally-restricted and long-acting MAS1 (LA-MAS1) agonist with potential to. reduce or replace MOR agonists for moderate-to-severe pain, and that will be non-addictive, safe and convenient. to use. The program is based on strong scientific evidence showing that activation of MAS1, a peptidic G protein-. coupled receptor (GPCR), produces opioid-independent and peripheral antinociceptive activity in a wide range. of animal models of chronic pain, including inflammatory, neuropathic and bone cancer pain. We propose to. conjugate existing short-acting peptidic MAS1 agonists to CVX-2000, a plug and play and re-usable antibody. carrier, previously clinically-validated for extending the half-life of peptides, and successfully used by us to create. other long-acting peripheral analgesics (LPAs), including long-acting kappa-opioid receptor (LA-KOR) agonists. and long-acting somatostatin receptor type 4 (LA-SSTR4) agonists. The resulting LA-MAS1 peptide-antibody. conjugates (PACs) will retain potent agonistic activity and selectivity at MAS1 while acquiring the pharmaco-. kinetic (PK) properties of the antibody carrier, thereby achieving both (i) long elimination half-life and (ii) high. peripheral selectivity. These two key features will provide LA-MAS1 agonists with a highly differentiated and. superior target product profile (TPP) in terms of efficacy, safety and convenience compared to short-acting and. brain-penetrating small molecule analgesics currently in development. The extended half-life will enable less. frequent, simpler and more convenient administration, i.e., once-weekly or twice-monthly subcutaneous dosing. that in turn will improve compliance while ensuring continuous drug exposure at effective plasma concentration,. which combined, will maximize efficacy. The lack of penetration in the central nervous system (CNS) will prevent. unnecessary and undesired interaction with the widely distributed MAS1 in the CNS, thereby eliminating any risk. of CNS-mediated MAS1 adverse effects. Finally, unlike MOR agonists, LA-MAS1 agonists will not induce. respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting, itching, constipation, drowsiness, mental cloudiness, dependence,. addiction or abuse. The current SBIR Phase I program aims to assess the chemical feasibility of creating potent,. selective and stable LA-MAS1 agonists. The subsequent Phase II program will include further lead optimization,. evaluation of efficacy, potency and duration of action in animal pain models, preclinical PK studies and selection. of a clinical candidate new biological entity (NBE) for nonclinical development. IMPACT & Relevance to Public Health: . This program has potential to bring forward novel, efficacious, non-addictive, safe and convenient. analgesics able to reduce or replace opioids for the treatment of moderate-to-severe pain, thus improving pain. control while maintaining patient safety and quality of life and helping society to curb the opioid crisis.",

While the health, social, and economic impacts of opioid addiction on adults and their communities are well. known, the impact of maternal opioid use and misuse on the fetus exposed in utero is less well understood.. The Outcomes of Babies with Opioid Exposure (OBOE) Study is a longitudinal cohort study to prospectively. examine the medical, neuroanatomical, neurodevelopmental, behavioral, and social/family/home outcomes. of children who were exposed to opioids in utero as compared with matched controls. The objectives of the. OBOE Study are to (1) determine the impact of antenatal opioid exposure on brain structure and. connectivity over the first 2 years of life; (2) define medical, developmental, and behavioral outcomes. over the first 2 years of life in infants exposed to opioids; and (3) explore whether and how the home. environment, maternal mental health, and parenting modify trajectories of brain connectivity and. neurodevelopment over the first 2 years of life. We hypothesize that neural connectivity and. neuroanatomical volumes are altered by prenatal opioid exposure and that the magnitude of these. alterations correlates with developmental and behavioral outcomes. Further, maternal and environmental. factors interact with prenatal opioid exposure to influence the trajectories of connectivity, development, and. behavior over the first 2 years of life. The OBOE Study Consortium includes four Clinical Sites (Case. Western University, Children's Hospital of Pennsylvania, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, and. the University of Alabama at Birmingham) and an independent Data Coordinating Center (DCC) at RTI. International, comprising an Administrative Core and a Research Support Core. The Consortium also. includes a neuroimaging core at the Children's National Medical Center, which has an extensive track record. of studying brain development in healthy and high-risk fetuses, newborns, and infants using advanced,. serial, multimodal MR imaging methods. The DCC and Clinical Sites have a long history of successful. collaborations on past and ongoing multisite neonatal follow-up studies, including the NICHD-funded. Neonatal Research Network. The proposed study has many innovations including (1) optimizing efficiencies. by leveraging ongoing collaborations; (2) integrating both MRI and neurodevelopmental data to obtain a. multidimensional evaluation of outcomes; (3) conducting serial MRI assessments to examine trajectories of. brain development within the first 2 years of life; (4) using umbilical cord assays to accurately measure. amounts of opioid and other substance exposure, which will allow us to examine dose-response effects; and. (5) using an innovative tablet application developed by the DCC that will assist with the informed consent. process to facilitate participant understanding among this high-risk population.",

This study leverages the established infrastructure and longstanding collaborations of four clinical sites and the data coordinating center of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network to address current critical knowledge gaps in childhood brain structure and connectivity and on medical, developmental, and behavioral trajectories in early childhood. The study will analyze a well-characterized observational cohort using clinical and neuroimaging measures to improve understanding of the structural and functional sequelae resulting from prenatal opioid exposure and NOWS and their interactions with the maternal-infant dyad.",

          "abstract_text": "Summary. Low back pain (LBP) is one of the most common reasons for all physician visits in the USA. The financial costs. associated with the care of LBP are staggering. The treatments for chronic low back pain (cLBP) are far from. satisfactory. Insurance claims data reveal that opioids are the most commonly prescribed class of drug for. back pain, and more than half of regular opioid users reported using them for the treatment of back pain.. Meanwhile, few new non-opioid and non-addictive pain medications have been developed in nearly five. decades; thus, there is an urgent need for the development of new therapies for chronic low back pain.. The vagus nerve (VN) consists of a complex network that regulates pain, mood, and the neuro-endocrine-. immune axis. Studies suggest that auricular transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS), a non-invasive. therapeutic method, can induce antinociception, which may affect peripheral and central nociception,. inflammatory responses, autonomic activity, and pain-related behavior. Clinical studies and our pilot study. have also shown that tVNS can significantly reduce symptoms of chronic pain and common comorbidities of. chronic pain, such as depression and anxiety, thereby endorsing its potential for the treatment of cLBP.. This proposal aims to investigate the treatment effect and underlying mechanism of tVNS on chronic low back. pain. Patients with chronic low back pain will be randomized to either real or sham tVNS treatment for one. month, with a three-month follow up. In addition to clinical outcome measurements, multiple brain imaging. modalities, Quantitative Sensory Testing, and blood inflammation markers will be assessed. We believe that. this study, if successful, will provide new treatment options for chronic low back pain, reduce the use of opioid. analgesics in chronic pain management, and enhance our understanding of the underlying mechanism of tVNS. treatment, as well as the pathophysiology and development of chronic pain.",
